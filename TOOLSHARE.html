                    She felt confused when the situtaion happens, then she felt down for finding solution with extra money.
                    But she feels excited when she knows there are apps to help her. The excitement turns to disapointment because of overwhelming apps and not finding suitable solutions for her situation. Later, she gets ToolShare which helps her to find solution for free or resonable prices.
